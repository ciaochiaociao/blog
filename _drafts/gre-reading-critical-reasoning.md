1. Cause Induction: 

Cause --(cause)--> Effect (EFFECT is already a fact, CAUSE is reasoned in the argument)

**argument is within CAUSE**

CAUSE be responsible for EFFECT
CAUSE cause EFFECT
CAUSE contribute to EFFECT
EFFECT be due to CAUSE
Sb attribute EFFECT to CAUSE
Sb credit EFFECT to CAUSE
EFFECT vary in proportion into CAUSE
hypothesize that, explanation(explain that), factor, the -er (CAUSE), the -er (EFFECT)

2. Result Deduction:

Premise (Happened) --(predict)--> Estimation (Not happen) (CAUSE/PREMISE is already a fact, EFFECT is reasoned in the argument)

**argument is within EFFECT**

CAUSE 
will, would, can, could, less/more, lead to, result in
EFFECT

3. Approach --(achieve)--> Goal (Not happen)

(CAUSE/Approach is assumed a fact, EFFECT/Goal is reasoned in the argument)

**argument is within EFFECT**

- approach: plan to, way, propose, should
- goal: to V, in order to V, attempt to V
- both: plan to V ... by Ving ..., aim to V ... by Ving ...


## Premise, Assumptions, Argument

Premise: stated presumption (taken as a fact in the argument)
Assumption: unstated presumption (taken as a fact in the argument)
Argument: author's opinion (CAUSE -> EFFECT)

How to find out the argumental sentence?
(@) Clearly, \____; Thefore, \____; Thus, \____
(@) conclude that \____; hypothesize that \____
(@) Since/If/Until/Unless \____, \____
(@) likely; unlikely; probably; would; will


## False Answer Typical Types

1. False Position
2. Out of the Scope of Topic or Role
3. Insufficient Evidence (Role)
4. Superset of Role
5. Irrelevent Topic or Role
6. Violate Assumption
7. Complement/Restate Old Information (Assumption)

## Types of Questions:
1. Weaken
2. Assumption
3. Support
4. Evaluate
5. Explain
6. Draw a Conclusion

## Counter argument - How to Weaken an Argument

- Negate Cause
  - Other Causes
  - Reverse Causality
  - Analogy
  	- Cause without Effect
  	- Effect without Cause

- Negate Effect
	- Multiple Factors

## Bonus I - What is Causality
 
From Wikipedia
:		Causality, or causation is efficacy, by which  
one process or state, a cause,  
contributes to the production of   
another process or state, an effect,  
where the cause is partly responsible for the effect,  
and the effect is partly dependent on the cause  

## Bonus II - Causal Fallacies (Logical Fallacies)

- Spurious Relationship (Confounding Factor, Lurking Variable, Inverted Forks, Collider, Survivorship bias, Selection/Representative Bias, Simpson Bias) (Correlation does not imply causation)
- Post hoc fallacy
- Reverse Causality
- Fallacy of Single Cause
- Genuine but Insignificant Cause
- Joint Effect
- Regression Fallacy
