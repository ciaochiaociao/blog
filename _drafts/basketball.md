- three-man: baller + 1 screen & 1 receiver or 2 screens
  - Basics
    - Flare screen: off-screen away from baller
    - Hammer screen: strong-side low-post + weak-side corner screen
    - Horn: two screens for baller
    - Chin Series: on-ball screen + give High Post and go
    - Split, Blind Pig, Pinch Post from TRIANGLE
    - Spain P&R: screen for the forward as the screener
  - Advanced:
    - Flare slip: fake flare screener cut
    - Horn flare: screen for the shooter as the screener
    - Chin Spain: Chin series + Spain P&R
    - 21 Pistol: (1 gives 2 at side-line) (D' Antoni and Steve Nash)
      - Give and Pitch then drive
      - Give and Pitch + inside-man off-ball screen for 2 to cut (alley-oop) (Mavericks)
      - Give and 1 on-ball screen for 2 (only two men)
      - Give (then keep) and inside-man on-ball screen for 2
      - No give and 2 on-ball screen for 1

- stagger (screen): four-man - 1 baller + 2 off-screens for receiver 
  - defensive tactic - top block: force the receiver
  - Variations:
    - stagger twirl (Celtics): 1st screener as the 2nd receiver
      - deal with top block
    - stagger lob (Lakers): twirl with 1st receiver screen for the 2nd screener to alley-oop
      - good when you have good alley-ooper
    - stagger X (Nick Nurse): X - pitch then P&R 
    - stagger as a bait (Bull)
- Two-man tactics:
  - screen (P&R or P&P):
    - baller:
      1. drag hesi making defender away from screener
      2. create spaces
      3. hip-to-hip/hand-to-hip
      4. (cross-over to) drive
    - screener:
      1. Roll to basket
      2. fake screen and slip to basket
      3. Pop to perimeter
      4. fake screen and pop to perimeter
      5. No roll but X cut (after baller drive)
    - variations:
      - P&R X (named by myself): jail ball defender + away from screener defender
        - no roll for screener
        - baller go earlier than inside man
      - fake screen and cut
      - fake screen and pop
  - Give&Go
    - Give to High Post and Cut (better with screen => chin series)
    - Give to Low Post and Cut
    - Give And Pitch (Pitch as a screener)
  - Pitch:
    - Fake Pitch and drive
    - Pitch then P&R
- Triangle (Low Post + corner + 45 at strong side)
  - To Low Post
    - two off-ballers (Wing with Top OR Wing with Corner) screen/fake-screen then split => **Split**
    - Wing-Corner Split + wing screen for weak-side to High Post
  - To corner then P&R with low post
  - Three main variations:
    - Split: Pass to Low Post + two off-ballers screen/fake-screen then split 
    - Pinch Post: Wing to Top to weak-side moving to High Post (key: Top to High Post)
    - Blind Pig: Wing to weak-side moving to High Post + Top cut (key: Wing to High Post)
      - Blind Pig can also mean **back screen** (because it is from the defender's **blind spot**)
- Chin Series VS Blind Pig:
  - similar: Give to High Post and Go
  - difference: Cut to Strong Side (Pinch Host) or to Weak Side with off-ball screen (Chin Series)

- Motion Strong (Big screen /  Staggered Screen to make 4-out to Horn)

  - Wing to Top First

- Motion Weak (cross-screen then down-screen to make 4-out to Horn)

  - Slot (Between Top and Wing) to Wing First
  - #4 down screen for the #2 cross-screener for #5 

- Motion Loop

  - Staggered Screen
  - Shallow Cut

- Screens:

  - Off-ball
    - Double Screen
    - Elevator 
    - Stagger
    - Floppy: Stagger + Off-ball Screen
    - Cross
    - Flex: cross-screen for baseline (often for smalls)
    - Back: off-ball screen to cut backdoor (weak-side baseline)
    - UCLA: off-ball screen at elbow to let cut strong-side (cut from wing to paint) (a bit similar to back screen)
  - On-ball:
    - Ram: down screen + on-ball screen
    - Flat: back screen for baller
    - Step Up: stepping out of the low post to set flat screen for baller
