## `\ufeff`

The Unicode character U+FEFF is the byte order mark, or BOM, and is used to tell the difference between big- and little-endian UTF-16 encoding. If you decode the web page using the right codec, Python will remove it for you.

1. open the file with encoding 'utf-8-sig'
2. `"\ufeff   0.9786733984947205".encode('utf-8').decode('utf-8-sig')`

Why it exists?

`'aaa'.encode('utf-8-sig').decode('utf-8')`
