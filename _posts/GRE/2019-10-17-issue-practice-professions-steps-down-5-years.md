C:
Not any profession in power, some that requires expert knowledge like law sector in gov. 
Corruption and new people => ranking, grading, or election, supervision system 

### Response

In many fields, the people who holds power for many years cause some problems such as preventing the other people from getting to a higher rank, or making the whole system corrupted. We should have a good system that is able to deal with it. However, we also need to consider the continuity of the policy made by those people and the required accumulation of the knowledge in need for that position. Therefore, I believe that, instead of requiring any people in power in any profession to step down every five years, most should step down if they fail some grading process except those who needs expert knowledge like the governor in the law sector of a government.

A good structure of an organization should always provide opportunities for freshmen to get promoted to a higher position. If we demand most people in a higher position to transfer to another position, there will be more vacancies in those positions available for other workers to pursue. For examples, in Taiwan's biggest business company, TBC, most workers want to be a manager to have a sustained career but there are only about a total of 100 managing positions for those around 5000 workers. By grading those 100 manager's performance every year, they would be forced to step down if they fail and a new manager would be selected from the others who have good performance.

In addition, a good system should also prevent corruption. A supervision system like grading those people's performance who are in power can eliminate those who are not doing good at their job. For examples, Taiwanese presidential election is a good exemplar. If a president in Taiwan does not do well so as to not earn most votes from people in Taiwan every four years, a new president who gets the most votes will be elected. Unlike other communists who are obnoxious for their corruption and bureaucracy for the lack of the supervision system, this provides a counter measure to corruption.

Admittedly, it is also true that the rotation in some high positions in business, government, education would ~deliorate~ deteriorate the sustainability of the policies. Therefore, instead of requiring any people in power in any profession in those fields to step down every five years, I propose that most should step down only if they fail some grading process except those who needs expert knowledge. For examples, for the governors in the law sector of a government, in order to maintain the sustainability of the law ~registrated~ legislated, they should only be required to step down if an independent organization find out they made some violations.
