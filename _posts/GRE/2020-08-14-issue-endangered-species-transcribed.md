Every day we see environmentalists advocating the importance of saving endangered species, not only for the sake fo humans but also for the lives of the animal themselves. As humans seem to have viciously destroyed a huge part of the livable habitat on earth, saving all endangered species seems to be right and normal. However, it is not possible for humans to save all endangered species because of the cost entailed. Therefore, I believe society should save endangered species only if their potential extinction is the result of the human activies. 

People claim that society should maintain the integrity of the ecosystem, so we should therefore save all endangered species. Indeed, the ecosystem fulfill many of our basic needs. The ecosystem gives us the water we drink, the scenery we view, and the flora and fauna we see. As the ecosystem is fragile, the death of one species may lead to the death of another species, and the chain effect could disrupt the whole ecosystem. In this case, it will be humans who suffer. For example, many flowers and plants rely on pollinating insects to survive. If these insects become extinct, many plants will die, leading to the death of mammals which eat these plants.

While the services that the ecosystem provides to humans are important, this doesn't mean that we "can" save all endangered species. As society must take care of its humna citizens first, we should also take the cost of saving endangered species into consideration. It's conceivable that the cost of saving endangered species will invovle a huge sum of money and effort. For example, to save one endangered species, society may have to initiate a project, hire a professional to lead the project, and hire many more people to find the threatened creatures. As there are millions of endangered species in the world, humans will have to prioritize.

To decide which species society should save, whether extinction is the result of human activities is a very good criterion, because there is a rule called "natural selection" in nature. Species have been living and dying on this planet for billions of years. It's obvious that the resources on earth are not enough for an indefinite number of species to rely upon, so creatures that are not intelligent enough or not agile enough are doomed to die. If humans tamper with this rule that has dominated the planet for years, then the limited resources on earth may be insufficient to be shared between both strong species and weak species.

While it's important to protect the ecosystem, saving all species is just not feasible. Therefore, difficult decisions must be made, and we should not save endangered species if their potential extinction is not the result of human activities.
