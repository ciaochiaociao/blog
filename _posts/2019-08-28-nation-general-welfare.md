### Response

**Intro Paragraph**

> Greatness exists in myriad forms, and can therefore be judged in a number of ways. To be great, an entity must excel at its calling or purpose. In the case of individuals past and present, it is fitting to ascribe greatness based on achievements in leadership, arts and sciences. For nations, however, there is only one way to achieve greatness. Because a nation only exists for the welfare of its people, the greatness of a nation hinges on this indicator alone. Hence, I agree with the statement that the surest indicator of a great nation is represented not by the achievements of its rulers, artists, or scientists, but by the general welfare of its people.

- Claim: the surest indicator of a great nation is represented by the general welfare of its people.

- Strategy: 

  1. Define the greatness 
  2. Define and distinguish between the individual greatness and the greatness of a nation 
  3. Connect the existence of a nation to the greatness of a nation

- Good Templates/Words/Collocation: 

  - in myriad forms = in various forms
  - calling
  - past and present
  - it is fitting to 
  - ascribe
  - ... only exists for ...
  - hinge on = depend on, is determined by
  - I agree with the statement that ...

**Argument Paragraph 1**

> The defining argument in support of the statement is that in order to be considered great at something then one must achieve greatness in that sphere alone. As previously stated, nations have been formed since antiquity for one reason alone: general welfare is increased when individuals band together. In the past, just as today, the burdensome struggle for life is lessened when groups of individuals work together for common good. On the contrary, it would be absurd to insinuate that nations were formed, rather than for general welfare, in order to allow individual artists or scientists the freedom to churn out noteworthy achievements. Accordingly, it should then be considered equally to judge the greatness of a nation primarily on individual achievement when nurturing individual achievement has always been secondary to welfare.

- Strategy: 

  1. Define how to achieve greatness (Bring up a factoid)
  2. Emphasize why the nation is formed. Connect the existence of a nation to the greatness of a nation
  3. Give negative scenarios

**Argument Paragraph 2**

> In addition, students need to know how to make friends with people in other countries. If they go abroad to study for one semester, they can meet people from different countries in a short period of time. For example, most Taiwanese students only have Taiwanese classmates. Even if they go traveling abroad, they will only have a brief chat with other travelers. In contrast, if they study abroad for one semester, they will have to spend months with roommates in their dormitory or with classmates at school. They can study together, travel together, and even drink beers at night together. These precious experiences will make students more open-minded and know what to do when they work in a global company in the future.

**Counter Argument Paragraph**
> Still, it is true that some students have sound reasons not to study abroad for one semester. Some students cannot afford the expenses associated with going abroad, and some need to focus on their research projects. Therefore, instead of requiring students to study abroad, school should encourage students to do so. If students decide to stay in their home country, then their decision should be respected. If the reason why students choose not to go abroad is that they do not have enough money, the school should partner with foreign schools where tuition and living expenses are low.

- Concession on opposite position:
