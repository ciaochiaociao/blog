## Others

### target-client 

is the name of the pty(7) file to which the client is connected, for example either of /dev/ttyp1 or ttyp1 for the client attached to /dev/ttyp1.  If no client is specified, tmux attempts to work out the client currently in use; if that fails, an error is reported. Clients may be listed with the list-clients command.

### target-session is tried as, in order:

1.   A session ID prefixed with a $.

2.   An exact name of a session (as listed by the list-sessions command).

3.   The start of a session name, for example ‘mysess’ would match a session named ‘mysession’.

4.   An fnmatch(3) pattern which is matched against the session name.

If the session name is prefixed with an ‘=’, only an exact match is accepted (so ‘=mysess’ will only match exactly ‘mysess’, not ‘mysession’).

### target-window 
specifies a window in the form session:window.  session follows the same rules as for target-session, and window is looked for in order as:

1.   A special token, listed below.
2.   A window index, for example ‘mysession:1’ is
window 1 in session ‘mysession’.
3.   A window ID, such as @1.
4.   An exact window name, such as ‘mysession:mywindow’.
5.   The start of a window name, such as ‘mysession:mywin’.
6.   As an fnmatch(3) pattern matched against the window name
```
     Token              Meaning
     {start}       ^    The lowest-numbered window
     {end}         $    The highest-numbered window
     {last}        !    The last (previously current) window
     {next}        +    The next window by number
     {previous}    -    The previous window by number
```
### target-pane
may be a pane ID or takes a similar form to target-window but with the optional addition of a period followed by a pane index or pane ID, for example: ‘mysession:mywindow.1’.  If the pane index is omitted, the      currently active pane in the specified window is used.
The following special tokens are available for the pane

```
     Token                  Meaning
     {last}            !    The last (previously active) pane
     {next}            +    The next pane by number
     {previous}        -    The previous pane by number
     {top}                  The top pane
     {bottom}               The bottom pane
     {left}                 The leftmost pane
     {right}                The rightmost pane
     {top-left}             The top-left pane
     {top-right}            The top-right pane
     {bottom-left}          The bottom-left pane
     {bottom-right}         The bottom-right pane
     {up-of}                The pane above the active pane
     {down-of}              The pane below the active pane
     {left-of}              The pane to the left of the active pane
     {right-of}             The pane to the right of the active pane
     
The tokens ‘+’ and ‘-’ may be followed by an offse

```bash

#CLIENTS AND SESSIONS
	# you will have multiple clients if you tmux from multiple terminals
	detach-client  # prefix d
	suspend-client  # prefix C-z  # send SIGTSTP (tty stop)
	choose-client  # prefix D => detach the chosen client

	switch-client -p/-n  # prefix ( / prefix )  # switch session for client
		 [-c target-client] [-t target-session] # Switch the current session for client target-client to target-session.
	attach-session  # attach/a  => create a new client in the current terminal and attach to the session or switch the current client
		If -d is specified, any other clients attached to the session are detached.  
		-r signifies the client is read-only (only keys bound to the detach-client or switch-client commands have any effect)
		-c will set the session working directory (used for new windows) to working-directory.  
		# https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/268386/how-to-change-default-new-window-directory-from-within-the-tmux
		# Ctrl+b :  # enter tmux command mode

	new[-session] [-n window-name] [-c start-directory]  # prefix C-c
		tmux new -s session-name -t target-session  # , e.g. for pair programming
        If -t is given, the new session is grouped with target-session.  This means they share the same set of
                 windows - all windows from target-session are linked to the new session and any subsequent new windows
                 or windows being closed are applied to both sessions.  The current and previous window and any session
                 options remain independent and either session may be killed without affecting the other.  Giving -n or
                 shell-command are invalid if -t is used.
	find-session "switch-client -t %%"  # prefix C-f

	choose-tree  # prefix s  # Put a window into tree choice mode, where either sessions or windows may be selected interactively from a list. -s starts with sessions collapsed and -w with windows collapsed (By default, windows belonging to a session are indented to show their relationship to a session. Note that the choose-window and choose-session commands are wrappers around choose-tree)

## tmux detach-client vs suspend-client

> ref: https://superuser.com/questions/1437846/difference-between-tmux-suspend-and-tmux-detach
>
> 1. Suspending the task sends SIGSTOP which pauses the client's process but does not terminate it.
>    - If you `ps wux | grep tmux` it will show up as stopped 'T'
>    - You can then resume it with either `fg` which brings the latest stopped task back to the foreground, or `tmux attach`.
>    - It is worth noting that `tmux attach` will connect to the first session.
>    - If you have 2 sessions, one suspended and one detached, `tmux attach` without a `-t session-name` will attach to the first one in the list.
>    - Using `fg`, a bash command will simply resume the last suspended task, whether that's `tmux` or not.
> 2. Detaching ends the client process.
>    - `ps wux | grep tmux` wont show the detached session.
>    - You can't resume it with `fg` but you can with `tmux attach` which creates a new client process to attach with.

## Issue of multiple clients connecting to tmux 
> ref: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7814612/is-there-any-way-to-redraw-tmux-window-when-switching-smaller-monitor-to-bigger
>
> Let's say you're connecting to a remote server over ssh with Terminal.app. When you "tmux attach" with bigger resolution monitor from smaller one you previously started tmux, it draws dots around the console. It doesn't fit the new window size. Is there any way to redraw and clean the window? 
>
> > tmux limits the dimensions of a window to the smallest of each dimension across all the sessions to which the window is attached. If it did not do this there would be no sensible way to display the whole window area for all the attached clients.
> > The easiest thing to do is to detach any other clients from the sessions when you attach:
> > `tmux attach -d` (prefix d) or `tmux choose-client` (prefix D) to choose the client to detach

Solutions: 

```bash
tmux list-clients
tmux detach -t <target_client>  # e.g. /dev/pts/32
# or
tmux attach[-session] -d <session>
# or simpler with
tmux a -d <session>
```
