```bash
sudo apt-add-repository ppa:fish-shell/release-3
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install fish

# install oh-my-fish
curl -L https://get.oh-my.fish | fish

# install theme
omf install spacefish
# or the later version of spacefish - starship
curl -fsSL https://starship.rs/install.sh | bash

touch ~/.config/fish/config.fish

# ~/.config/fish/config.fish
starship init fish | source
```

## Plugins

### [plugin-git](https://github.com/jhillyerd/plugin-git)

```
omf install https://github.com/jhillyerd/plugin-git
```

**git-flow**

```
omf install git-flow
```

### [fzf](https://github.com/jethrokuan/fzf)

Fuzzy Finder or fzf is a general purpose command line tool to find anything faster, be it your files or the command history.

```
$ omf install https://github.com/jethrokuan/fzf
```

To search through your command history, you can use the combo `ctrl + r` or write some part of the command and hit the combo to find only the commands that match your query.

### **working with bash**

One of the quirks of fish shell is that it cannot run few bash utilities natively like [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/n) . For this you need a package named [bass](https://github.com/edc/bass)to expose nvm to fish shell.

basscreates a framework to support other bash utility packages, like the one we will be using called [fish-nvm](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/fish-nvm) .

**working with virtualenv üêç**

This is just one of the gotchas of working with fish shell. When you are working with the Python virtual environment , you cannot activate is the normal way.

```
$ python -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
```

Instead, fish shell adds a script called activate.fish to enable the shell.

```
$ source venv/bin/activate.fish
```

### [pj](https://github.com/oh-my-fish/plugin-pj)

pj allows you to easily jump between your favorite directories in a predictable manner. You tell pj where to look for your projects/folders, and it will allow you to jump there easily with tab completion.

```
$ omf install pj
```

For example: I have a folder called test in my home directory with a bunch of other folders.

To mark the test folder as jump target we need to set the project path:

```
$ set -Ux PROJECT_PATHS ~/test
```

Now I can jump between the folders inside the test directory from any location in my terminal.

```
$ pj
```

### [**z**](https://github.com/jethrokuan/z)

z is similar to pj but it is intelligent in a sense that it keeps track of your most visited folders so you can jump in that location easily.

```
$ omf install z
```

## Syntax

```
functions --all/-a

alias --all/-a --erase/-e --rename/-r OLD NEW --query/-q --universal/-U

abbr --show/-s --list/-l
abbr --add/-a --global/-g WORD EXPANSION 

```

### Abbr

https://fishshell.com/docs/current/cmds/abbr.html

Each abbreviation is stored in its own global or universal variable. The name consists of the prefix `_fish_abbr_` followed by the WORD after being transformed by `string escape style=var`. The WORD cannot contain a space but all other characters are legal.

Defining an abbreviation with global scope is slightly faster than universal scope (which is the default). But in general you'll only want to use the global scope when defining abbreviations in a startup script like `~/.config/fish/config.fish` like this:

```
if status --is-interactive
    abbr --add --global first 'echo my first abbreviation'
    abbr --add --global second 'echo my second abbreviation'
    abbr --add --global gco git checkout
    # etcetera
end
```

You can create abbreviations interactively and they will be visible to other fish sessions if you use the `-U` or `--universal` flag or don't explicitly specify the scope and the abbreviation isn't already defined with global scope. If you want it to be visible only to the current shell use the `-g` or `--global` flag.
