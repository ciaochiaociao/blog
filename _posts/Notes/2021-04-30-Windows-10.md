## Hyper-V vs Hypervisor Platform vs Virutal Machine Platform

- `Hyper-V` is Microsoft's Hypervisor.
- `Virtual Machine Platform` - "Enables platform support for virtual machines" and is required for [WSL2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/wsl2-about). Virtual Machine Platform can be used to create MSIX Application packages for an App-V or MSI.
- `Windows Hypervisor Platform` - "Enables virtualization software to run on the Windows hypervisor" and at one time was required for [Docker on Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/#system-requirements). The Hypervisor platform is an API that third-party developers can use in order to use Hyper-V. Oracle VirtualBox, Docker, and QEMU are examples of these projects.

> The Windows Hypervisor Platform adds an extended user-mode API for third-party virtualization stacks and applications to create and manage partitions at the hypervisor level, configure memory mappings for the partition, and create and control the execution of virtual processors.
