jupyter console --kernel <name>  # other kernel, which can be even in other programmming language
jupyter qtconsole  # Use QT if available such as in Ubuntu Desktop
jupyter notebook

jupyter labextension
jupyter bundlerextension
jupyter labhub  # Launch jupyterhub. JupyterHub is the best way to serve Jupyter notebook for multiple users. It can be used in a class of students, a corporate data science group or scientific research group. It is a multi-user Hub that spawns, manages, and proxies multiple instances of the single-user Jupyter notebook server.

jupyter nbclassic  # NBClassic is a Jupyter Server extension that serves the Notebook frontend (i.e. all static assets) on top of Jupyter Server. It even loads Jupyter Notebook’s config files. NBClassic will only work for a limited time. Jupyter Server is likely to evolve beyond a point where Jupyter Notebook frontend will no longer work with the underlying server. Consider switching to JupyterLab or nteract where there is active development happening.

jupyter --paths
```

## jupyter kernelspec install

Note that this command will create a new configuration for the kernel in one of the preferred location (see `jupyter --paths` command for more details):

- system-wide (e.g. /usr/local/share),
- in Jupyter’s env (sys.prefix/share),
- per-user (~/.local/share or ~/Library/share)

## Install jupyter lab(2021/03/24  3.0.12)

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab

# or

pip install jupyterlab
```

## Jupyter Lab Extensions

 There are two types of JupyterLab extensions: 

- a *source extension* (which requires a rebuild of JupyterLab when installed), and 
  - Rebuilding JupyterLab requires Node.js to be [installed](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/extensions.html#installing-nodejs).
- a *prebuilt extension* (which does not require a rebuild of JupyterLab).

JupyterLab extensions can be installed in a number of ways, including:

- Python `pip` or `conda` packages can include either a source extension or a prebuilt extension. These packages may also include a server-side component necessary for the extension to function.
- The Extension Manager in JupyterLab and the `jupyter labextension install` command can install source extension packages from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=keywords:jupyterlab-extension). Installing a source extension requires Node.js and a JupyterLab rebuild to activate.

## what is actually executed when you type python ? (python executable location)

you can use the type shell command:

```python
!type python

#Install a pip/conda package in the current Jupyter kernel
import sys
!{sys.executable} -m pip install numpy
!conda install --prefix {sys.prefix} numpy
```

## install ipywidgets in Jupyter Lab

ref: https://github.com/nodesource/distributions/blob/master/README.md

```
!curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x | bash -
!apt-get install -y nodejs

!pip install ipywidgets
!jupyter nbextension enable --py widgetsnbextension

!jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager
(for ipywidgets to work in jupyter lab)
```

## use ipywidgets
### interact

```
from ipywidgets import interact, interact_manual

@interact or @ interact_manual
def f(x=[...], y=10, z='text', w=(0,100,10), v={'opt1': 'val1', 'opt2': 'val2'}):
	...
```

## notebook
 ### full-width
