## Basic

```
$!  # last pid
$?  # last exit code
```



## Data Types

### Array

```
declare -a some_list
somelist[$index]=value
echo ${somelist[*]}  # values
echo ${somelist[@]}
echo ${!somelist[*]}  # keys
echo ${!somelist[@]}  # keys
```

## Flow Control

```bash
if TEST-COMMAND
then
  STATEMENTS1
else
  STATEMENTS2
fi

if TEST-COMMAND1
then
  STATEMENTS1
elif TEST-COMMAND2
then
  STATEMENTS2
else
  STATEMENTS3
fi

for ...
do
...
done

while read line
do
...
done < file



# list of values
for var in a b c

# loop with parameter expansion
chars='a b c'
for var in $chars  # no double quotes to enable word splitting

# looping positional arguments of shell script
for i in $@

# loop values in an array  (declare -a mylist;mylist[0]=a;mylist[1]=b;)
for val in ${mylist[*]}

# for loop with command substition
for OUTPUT in $(Linux-Or-Unix-Command-Here)

# looping files
for file in /etc/*  # no double quotes to enable word splitting
for file in "$1"/*  # only double quotes the variable instead of the whole pattern

# loop range (1 2 3 4 5)
	for i in {1..5}  # Latest bash version 3.0+ has inbuilt support for setting up ranges:
	
    # 0 2 4 6 8 10
    for i in {0..10..2}

    # old-fashioned. `seq` command to create sequence for looping
    for i in $(seq 1 2 20)  # command substitution. print a sequence of numbers
    # Three-expression (heritage from C)
    for (( c=1; c<=5; c++ )) # `(())`: arithmetic expression. note expressions should be used intead of numbers

    # infinite loops
    for (( ; ; ))

# loop string and range
for x in run.{0..10}.txt

# conditional exit with break
for file in /etc/*
do
	if [ "${file}" == "/etc/resolv.conf" ]
	then
		break or continue
	fi
done
```

### Read

```
read -a array < file  # read the first lin
read 
```



## Redirection

```
... 3>&-
# The 3>&- close the file descriptor number 3 (it probably has been opened before with 3>filename).
```



## String Interpolation

```
name = ${filename%.*}
ext = ${filename##*.}
```

## Parameter Dereferencing

```
$var
```



## Parameter Expansion

https://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/parameter-substitution.html

```
echo "${var}"
echo "Substitute the value of var."


echo "${var:-word}"
echo "If var is null or unset, word is substituted for var. The value of var does not change."


echo "${var:=word}"
echo "If var is null or unset, var is set to the value of word."


echo "${var:?message}"
echo "If var is null or unset, message is printed to standard error. This checks that variables are set correctly."


echo "${var:+word}"
echo "If var is set, word is substituted for var. The value of var does not change."
```

### Default Values In Shell
ref: 
 - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/307503/whats-a-concise-way-to-check-that-environment-variables-are-set-in-a-unix-shell/307735#307735
 - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2013547/assigning-default-values-to-shell-variables-with-a-single-command-in-bash

```
VARIABLE=${1:-DEFAULTVALUE}

#these commands act like the same
VARIABLE=${VARIABLE:-DEFAULTVALUE} # If variable not set or null, use default.
VARIABLE=${VARIABLE-DEFAULTVALUE} # If variable not set, use default.
VARIABLE=${VARIABLE:=DEFAULTVALUE} # If variable not set or null, set it to default.
VARIABLE=${VARIABLE=DEFAULTVALUE} # If variable not set or null, set it to default.
VARIABLE=${VARIABLE:?DEFAULTVALUE}
VARIABLE=${VARIABLE?DEFAULTVALUE}
: "${VARIABLE:=DEFAULTVALUE}"  # commonly used
: "${VARIABLE=DEFAULTVALUE}"
[ -z VARIABLE ] && VARIABLE=DEFAULTVALUE
```
### Differences between `:-`, `=`, `:=`
```
VARIABLE=${VARIABLE:-DEFAULTVALUE} # If variable not set or null, use default.
VARIABLE=${VARIABLE:=DEFAULTVALUE} # If variable not set or null, set it to default.
```
### Differences between `?` and `:?`
```
: ${STATE?"Need to set STATE"}
: ${DEST:?"Need to set DEST non-empty"}
```
or better
```
: "${STATE?Need to set STATE}"
: "${DEST:?Need to set DEST non-empty}"
```

## The Colon Command
- I should probably add that the colon command simply has its arguments evaluated and then succeeds. 
- the `:` command doesn't echo its arguments (but the shell does evaluate the arguments
- It is the original shell comment notation (before '#' to end of line). For a long time, Bourne shell scripts had a colon as the first character. The C Shell would read a script and use the first character to determine whether it was for the C Shell (a '#' hash) or the Bourne shell (a ':' colon). Then the kernel got in on the act and added support for '#!/path/to/program' and the Bourne shell got '#' comments, and the colon convention went by the wayside. But if you come across a script that starts with a colon, now you will know why.

## Internal Field Separator (IFS)
it's a character that separates fields



## Double Quotes
ref: https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki/SC2086

```
echo $1
for i in $*; do :; done # this one and the next one also apply to expanding arrays.
for i in $@; do :; done
```

`$1` code looks like "print the first argument". It's actually "Split the first argument by IFS (spaces, tabs and line feeds). Expand each of them as if it was a glob. Join all the resulting strings and filenames with spaces. Print the result."
The second one looks like "iterate through all arguments". It's actually "join all the arguments by the first character of IFS (space), split them by IFS and expand each of them as globs, and iterate on the resulting list". 
The third one skips the joining part.

### My Test

```
echo 'echo "$0 $@"'
echo "$0 $@"
echo 'echo $1'
echo $1
echo 'echo "$1"'
echo "$1"
echo 'for i in $*; do echo $i; done'
for i in $*; do echo $i; done
echo 'for i in "$*"; do echo $i; done'
for i in "$*"; do echo $i; done
echo 'for i in $@; do echo $i; done'
for i in $@; do echo $i; done
echo 'for i in "$@"; do echo $i; done'
for i in "$@"; do echo $i; done
```


```
> sh test.sh 1\ 2\ 3 4 5
test.sh 1 2 3 4 5
echo $1
1 2 3
echo "$1"
1 2 3
for i in $*; do echo $i; done  # join and splitting by IFS
1
2
3
4
5
for i in "$*"; do echo $i; done  # join and splitting by IFS. Prevent globbing and word splitting
1 2 3 4 5
for i in $@; do echo $i; done  # splitting by IFS
1
2
3
4
5
for i in "$@"; do echo $i; done  # splitting by IFS. Prevent globbing and word splitting

### `$FUNCNAME`
- Its a global internal variable maintained by any linux shell. 
- Its of type array and consists the name of the current function from where we are trying to read its value. 
- FUNCNAME[0] is the current function name and FUNCNAME[1] is the previous function name and so on ... Its a stack-trace of functions executed by a shell script. 
- Value of FUNCNAME gets cleared every-time we execute a new shell script.

*trap 0: If a sigspec is EXIT (0) the command arg is executed on exit from the shell.* (different from 0 signal in `kill`, which just dry-run kill)

## Signals in Shell
ref: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/251195/difference-between-less-violent-kill-signal-hup-1-int-2-and-term-15
SIGKILL never fails to kill a running process, that's the point. Other signals exist to give the application a chance to react.

The default behavior of SIGINT, SIGTERM, SIGQUIT and SIGHUP is to kill the program. However applications are allowed to install a handler for these signals. So the actual behavior of applications when they receive these signals is a matter of convention (which each application may or may not follow), not of system design.

SIGINT is the “weakest” of the lot. Its conventional meaning is “stop what you're doing right now and wait for further user input”. It's the signal generated by Ctrl+C in a terminal. Non-interactive programs generally treat it like SIGTERM.

SIGTERM is the “normal” kill signal. It tells the application to exit cleanly. The application might take time to save its state, to free resources such as temporary files that would otherwise stay behind, etc. An application that doesn't want to be interrupted during a critical application might ignore SIGTERM for a while.

SIGHUP is about the same as SIGTERM in terms of harshness, but it has a specific role because it's automatically sent to applications running in a terminal when the user disconnects from that terminal (etymologically, because the user was connecting via a telephone line and the modem hung up). SIGHUP is often involuntary, unlike SIGTERM which has to be sent explicitly, so applications should try to save their state on a SIGHUP. SIGHUP also has a completely different conventional meaning for non-user-facing applications (daemons), which is to reload their configuration file.

SIGQUIT is the harshest of the ignorable signals. It's meant to be used when an application is misbehaving and needs to be killed now, and by default it traditionally left a core dump file (modern systems where most users wouldn't know what a core file is tend to not produce them by default). Applications can set a handler but should do very little (in particular not save any state) because the intent of SIGQUIT is to be used when something is seriously wrong.
SIGQUIT should not only leave a core dump, but also omit most of/all of the cleanups (like deleting temporary files); I always think of it of a somewhat debugging signal; "Certain kinds of cleanups are best omitted in handling SIGQUIT. For example, if the program creates temporary files, it should handle the other termination requests by deleting the temporary files. But it is better for SIGQUIT not to delete them, so that the user can examine them in conjunction with the core dump." gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Termination-Signals.html – SantaXL Dec 15 '19 at 14:52

## `SIGSPEC`: `EXIT`/`RETURN`/`DEBUG`/`ERR`

ref: https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Bourne-Shell-Builtins.html

If a sigspec is 0 or EXIT, arg is executed when the shell exits. If a sigspec is DEBUG, the command arg is executed before every simple command, for command, case command, select command, every arithmetic for command, and before the first command executes in a shell function ...

If a sigspec is ERR, the command arg is executed whenever a pipeline (which may consist of a single simple command), a list, or a compound command returns a non-zero exit status, subject to the following conditions ...

Both `SIGSPEC` and signals can be trapped with `trap` command

## Command Substitution

Command substitution allows the output of a command to replace the command itself. Command substitution occurs when a command is enclosed as follows:

```
$(command)
#or
`command`
```

## Arithmetic Expansion/Expression

https://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/arithexp.html

Arithmetic expansion allows the evaluation of an arithmetic expression and the substitution of the result.

`(( expression ))`: expression execution

`$(( expression ))`: expansion

```
# 1. backticks (old-fashioned. superceded by 2 and 3)
z=`expr $z + 3`          # The 'expr' command performs the expansion.

# 2. double parentheses 
# ((EXPRESSION)) executes the expression
# $((EXPRESSION)) executes the expression AND do paramater dereferencing (expansion). Used for assignment
z=$(($z+3))
z=$((z+3)) #  Within double parentheses, parameter dereferencing is optional.
(( n += 1 ))
# (( $n += 1 )) will induce error because $n will be expanded to value and value cannot be assigned. On the contrary, the above one 'n' is a variable instead, which can be assigned.
# $(( n += 1 )) will execute the expression and expand the parameter $n. And it will induce error if this is called only because there is no command named, e.g., 1 or 2, the value expanded by $n

# 3. let
let z=z+3
let "z += 3"  #  Quotes permit the use of spaces in variable assignment.
              #  The 'let' operator actually performs arithmetic evaluation,
              #+ rather than expansion.
```

## Process Substitution

Process substitution allows a process’s input or output to be referred to using a filename. Process substitution uses `/dev/fd/<n>` files to send the results of the process(es) within parentheses to another process. It takes the form of

```sh
<(command_list)  # Redirect command_list's stdout content to file /dev/fd/<n> and the file (filename) serves as an arg to outter command
```

or

```sh
>(command_list)  # file /dev/fd/<n> serve as an arg to outter command. Then redirect the file content to command_list's stdin
```

```
# check which /dev/fd/<n> 
echo <(true)  # same as true > /dev/fd/<n>; echo /dev/fd/<n>
echo >(true)  # same as echo /dev/fd/<n>; true < /dev/fd/<n>
echo >(true) <(true)  # same as true > /dev/fd/1; echo /dev/fd/2 < /dev/fd/1; true < /dev/fd/2
diff <(ls $first_directory) <(ls $second_directory)
comm <(ls -l) <(ls -al)

while read x
do
	..."$x"
done < <(command)

tar cf >(bzip2 -c > file.tar.bz2) $directory_name
# same as
tar cf /dev/fd/?? $directory_name
bzip2 -c < /dev/fd/?? > file.tar.bz2
rm /dev/fd/??

ls > >(wc -l)  # ls | wc -l  or  ls > /dev/fd/??; wc -l < /dev/fd/??
wc -l <(ls)
wc -l < <(ls)
# note that: `wc -l $(ls)` is different that it runs `wc -l` for each listed names

```
