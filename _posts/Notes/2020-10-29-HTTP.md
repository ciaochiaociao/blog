```
curl 
 -L, --location      Follow redirects (H)
 -k, --insecure      Allow insecure server connections when using SSL
 -o, --output FILE   Write to FILE instead of stdout
 -O, --remote-name
	Write output to a local file named like the remote file we get. (Only the file part of the remote file is used, the path is cut off.)
	The remote file name to use for saving is extracted from the given URL, nothing else.
	Consequentially,  the  file  will  be  saved  in the current working directory. If you want the file saved in a different directory, make sure you change current working directory before you
	invoke curl with the -O, --remote-name flag!
	There is no URL decoding done on the file name. If it has %20 or other URL encoded parts of the name, they will end up as-is as file name.
	You may use this option as many times as the number of URLs you have.
 -S, --show-error    Show error. With -s, make curl show errors when they occur
 -s, --silent        Silent mode (don't output anything)
     --connect-timeout SECONDS  Maximum time allowed for connection
        Maximum  time  in  seconds  that you allow the connection to the
        server to take.  This only limits  the  connection  phase,  once
        curl has connected this option is of no more use.
 -m, --max-time SECONDS  Maximum time allowed for the transfer
        Maximum  time  in  seconds that you allow the whole operation to
        take.  This is useful for preventing your batch jobs from  hang‐
        ing  for  hours due to slow networks or links going down.  
 -i, --include       Include protocol headers in the output (H/F)  # good for debugging
 -e, --referer <URL>
	 (HTTP) Sends the "Referrer Page" information to the HTTP server. This can also be set with the -H, --header flag of course.  When used with -L, --location  you  can  append  ";auto"  to  the --referer URL to make curl automatically set the previous URL when it follows a Location: header. The ";auto" string can be used alone, even if you don't set an initial --referer.
	If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.
-H, --header <header>
    (HTTP)  Extra  header to include in the request when sending HTTP to a server. You may specify any number of extra headers. Note that if you should add a custom header that has the same name as one of the internal ones curl would use, your externally set header will be used instead of the internal one. This allows you to make even trickier stuff than curl would normally do.  You should  not replace internally set headers without knowing perfectly well what you're doing. Remove an internal header by giving a replacement without content on the right side of the colon, as in: -H "Host:". If you send the custom header with no-value then its header must be terminated with a semicolon, such as -H "X-Custom-Header;" to send "X-Custom-Header:".
	curl will make sure that each header you add/replace is sent with the proper end-of-line marker, you should thus not add that as a part of the header content: do not add newlines or carriage returns, they will only mess things up for you.

	See also the -A, --user-agent and -e, --referer options.

	Starting in 7.37.0, you need --proxy-header to send custom headers intended for a proxy.

	Example:

	# curl -H "X-First-Name: Joe" http://192.168.0.1/

	WARNING:  headers  set  with  this option will be set in all requests - even after redirects are followed, like when told with -L, --location. This can lead to the header being sent to other hosts than the original host, so sensitive headers should be used with caution combined with following redirects.
	This option can be used multiple times to add/replace/remove multiple headers.
-I, --head
    (HTTP/FTP/FILE) Fetch the HTTP-header only! HTTP-servers feature the command HEAD which this uses to get nothing but the header of a document. When used on an FTP or FILE file, curl displays the file size and last modification time only
-i, --include
	(HTTP) Include the HTTP-header in the output. The HTTP-header includes things like server-name, date of the document, HTTP-version and more...
