## Expose vs Publish 

1) If you specify neither EXPOSE nor -p, the service in the container will only be accessible from inside the container itself.

2) If you EXPOSE a port, the service in the container is not accessible from outside Docker, but from inside other Docker containers. So this is good for inter-container communication.

3) If you EXPOSE and -p a port, the service in the container is accessible from anywhere, even outside Docker.

```
-P: publish all "exposed" ports
--expose
-p, --publish
```

## Save only the last image (reduce the image size) by `docker export` & `docker import`

(Note that the later version of `docker` can use `docker squash` command instead of `docker export`.

```
docker export container_name > file.tar
cat file.tar | docker import - image_name:tag
```

This will have the issue that only the filesystem are saved, which means that many things that have been done in the initial `Dockerfile` are not saved, e.g., **environment varaibles**. This will cause some issue like `torch.cuda.is_available()` will not return `True` (c.f. `2020-07-11-cuda-cudnn.md`).

`docker export` vs `docker save`

(c.f. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22655867/what-is-the-difference-between-save-and-export-in-docker)

> - `save` will fetch an image : for a VM or a physical server, that would be the installation .ISO image or disk. The base operating system.
>
>   It will pack the layers and metadata of all the chain required to build the image. You can then load this "saved" images chain into another docker instance and create containers from these images.
>
> - `export` will fetch the whole container : like a snapshot of a regular VM. Saves the OS of course, but also any change you made, any data file written during the container life. This one is more like a traditional backup.
>
>   It will give you a flat .tar archive containing the filesystem of your container.

## CMD vs ENTRYPOINT vs RUN

Use RUN instructions to build your image by adding layers on top of initial image.

Prefer ENTRYPOINT to CMD when building executable Docker image and you need a command always to be executed. Additionally use CMD if you need to provide extra default arguments that could be overwritten from command line when docker container runs.

Choose CMD if you need to provide a default command and/or arguments that can be overwritten from command line when docker container runs.



shell form: <instruction> <command>  ---> /bin/sh -c <command>
exec form: <instruction> ["executable", "param1", "param2", ...]  ---> executable param1 param2 (calls executable directly. Note that any $var will not be substituted.)

For bash: use exec form - ["/bin/bash", "-c", "<command>"]

RUN: executes command(s) in a new layer and creates a new image. 

CMD: default command, which will be executed only when you "run" container without specifying a command (If Docker container runs with a command, the default command will be ignored. If Dockerfile has more than one CMD instruction, all but last CMD instructions are ignored.)

CMD ["param1","param2"] (sets additional default parameters for ENTRYPOINT in exec form)
It sets default parameters that will be added after ENTRYPOINT parameters if container runs without command line arguments.

ENTRYPOINT: configure a container that will run as an executable. ENTRYPOINT command and parameters are not ignored when Docker container runs with command line parameters. 



## install
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
  bzr \
  cvs \
  git \
  mercurial \
  subversion

Note that apt-get update and apt-get install are executed in a single RUN instruction. This is done to make sure that the latest packages will be installed. If apt-get install were in a separate RUN instruction, then it would reuse a layer added by apt-get update, which could had been created a long time ago.

# GPU

```
NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES  # the GPUs that can be used, which can only be set at the `docker run`. Even if it changed in the container, it does not effect.
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES  # the GPUs that are used, which can be changed in container
```

# Others

## Change the Dockerfile content/instructions in existing container

```
docker commit --change "CMD ["apachectl", "-DFOREGROUND"]' -c "EXPOSE 80" c3f279d17e0a  svendowideit/testimage:version4
docker commit --change "ENV DEBUG true" c3f279d17e0a  svendowideit/testimage:version3
# The --change option will apply Dockerfile instructions to the image that is created. Supported Dockerfile instructions: CMD|ENTRYPOINT|ENV|EXPOSE|LABEL|ONBUILD|USER|VOLUME|WORKDIR
```

The `--change` option will apply `Dockerfile` instructions to the image that is created. Supported `Dockerfile` instructions: `CMD`|`ENTRYPOINT`|`ENV`|`EXPOSE`|`LABEL`|`ONBUILD`|`USER`|`VOLUME`|`WORKDIR`
