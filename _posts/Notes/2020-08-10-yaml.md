## Collections

1. YAML’s [block collections](https://yaml.org/spec/1.1/#block collection style/information model) use [indentation](https://yaml.org/spec/1.1/#indentation space/) for scope and begin each entry on its own line. [Block sequences](https://yaml.org/spec/1.1/#block sequence style/information model) indicate each entry with a dash and space ( [“**`-`**”](https://yaml.org/spec/1.1/#- block sequence entry/)). [Mappings](https://yaml.org/spec/1.1/#mapping/information model) use a colon and space ([“**`: `**”](https://yaml.org/spec/1.1/#: mapping value/)) to mark each [mapping key](https://yaml.org/spec/1.1/#key/information model): [value](https://yaml.org/spec/1.1/#value/information model) pair.
2. YAML also has [flow styles](https://yaml.org/spec/1.1/#flow style/information model), using explicit [indicators](https://yaml.org/spec/1.1/#indicator/) rather than [indentation](https://yaml.org/spec/1.1/#indentation space/) to denote scope. The [flow sequence](https://yaml.org/spec/1.1/#flow sequence style/information model) is written as a comma separated list within square brackets. In a similar manner, the [flow mapping](https://yaml.org/spec/1.1/#flow mapping style/information model) uses curly braces.

## Structures

- YAML uses three dashes ([“**`---`**”](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#marker/directives end/)) to separate [directives](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#directive//) from [document](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#document//) [content](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#content//). This also serves to signal the start of a document if no [directives](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#directive//) are present. Three dots ( [“**`...`**”](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#marker/document end/)) indicate the end of a document without starting a new one, for use in communication channels.

```
---
time: 20:03:20
player: Sammy Sosa
action: strike (miss)
...
---
time: 20:03:47
player: Sammy Sosa
action: grand slam
...
```

- Repeated [nodes](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#node//) (objects) are first [identified](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#alias/identified/) by an [anchor](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#anchor//) (marked with the ampersand - [“**`&`**”](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#& anchor//)), and are then [aliased](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#alias//) (referenced with an asterisk - [“**`\*`**”](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#* alias//)) thereafter.

**Example 2.10. Node for “\**`Sammy Sosa`\**”
appears twice in this document**

```
---hr:
  - Mark McGwire
  # Following node labeled SS
  - &SS Sammy Sosa
rbi:
  - *SS # Subsequent occurrence
  - Ken Griffey
```

- A question mark and space ([“**`? `**”](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#? mapping key//)) indicate a complex [mapping](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#mapping//) [key](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#key//). Within a [block collection](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#style/block/collection), [key: value pairs](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#key: value pair//) can start immediately following the [dash](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#- block sequence entry//), [colon](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#: mapping value//), or [question mark](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#? mapping key//).

**Example 2.11. Mapping between Sequences**

```
? - Detroit Tigers  - Chicago cubs
:
  - 2001-07-23

? [ New York Yankees,
    Atlanta Braves ]
: [ 2001-07-02, 2001-08-12,
    2001-08-14 ]
```

## Scalars

- Block scalars: [Scalar content](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#scalar//) can be written in [block](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#style/block/) notation, using a [literal style](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#style/block/literal) (indicated by [“**`|`**”](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#| literal style//)) where all [line breaks](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#line break//) are significant. Alternatively, they can be written with the [folded style](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#style/block/folded) [(denoted by “**`>`**”](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#> folded style//)) where each [line break](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#line break//) is [folded](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#line folding//) to a [space](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#space//) unless it ends an [empty](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#empty line//) or a [more-indented](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#more-indented//) line.

- Flow scalars: YAML’s [flow scalars](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#style/flow/scalar) include the [plain style](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#style/flow/plain) (most examples thus far) and two quoted styles. The [double-quoted style](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#style/flow/double-quoted) provides [escape sequences](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#escaping/in double-quoted scalars/). The [single-quoted style](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#style/flow/) is useful when [escaping](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#escaping/in double-quoted scalars/) is not needed. All [flow scalars](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#style/flow/scalar) can span multiple lines; [line breaks](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#line break//) are always [folded](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#line folding//).

## Tags

In YAML, [untagged nodes](https://yaml.org/spec/1.1/#non-specific tag/) are given an type depending on the [application](https://yaml.org/spec/1.1/#application/). The examples in this specification generally use the [“**`seq`**”](https://yaml.org/type/seq.html), [“**`map`**”](https://yaml.org/type/map.html) and [“**`str`**”](https://yaml.org/type/str.html) types from the [YAML tag repository](https://yaml.org/type/index.html). A few examples also use the [“**`int`**”](https://yaml.org/type/int.html) and [“**`float`**”](https://yaml.org/type/float.html) types. The repository includes additional types such as [“**`null`**”](https://yaml.org/type/null.html), [“**`bool`**”](https://yaml.org/type/bool.html), [“**`set`**”](https://yaml.org/type/set.html) and others.

**Example 2.19. Integers**

```
canonical: 12345
decimal: +12,345
sexagesimal: 3:25:45
octal: 014
hexadecimal: 0xC
```

**Example 2.20. Floating Point**

```
canonical: 1.23015e+3
exponential: 12.3015e+02
sexagesimal: 20:30.15
fixed: 1,230.15
negative infinity: -.inf
not a number: .NaN
```

**Example 2.21. Miscellaneous**

```
null: ~
true: y
false: n
string: '12345'
```

Explicit typing is denoted with a [tag](https://yaml.org/spec/1.1/#tag/information model) using the exclamation point ([“**`!`**”](https://yaml.org/spec/1.1/#! tag indicator/)) symbol. [Global tags](https://yaml.org/spec/1.1/#global tag/) are URIs and may be specified in a [shorthand](https://yaml.org/spec/1.1/#tag shorthand/) form using a [handle](https://yaml.org/spec/1.1/#tag handle/). [Application](https://yaml.org/spec/1.1/#application/)-specific [local tags](https://yaml.org/spec/1.1/#local tag/) may also be used.

**Example 2.22. Timestamps**

```
canonical: 2001-12-15T02:59:43.1Z
iso8601: 2001-12-14t21:59:43.10-05:00
spaced: 2001-12-14 21:59:43.10 -5
date: 2002-12-14
```
