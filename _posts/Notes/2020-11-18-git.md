# tracking/staging(to staging area / index / cached)
git add <=> git rm --cached [--ignore-unmatch] [--]  # "`rm` only in index" / "stage the `rm` in index without affecting worktree" and be careful doing it that way. If this was an existing file you just staged the deletion of the file. => use git reset HEAD <filename> instead
git add [--all --ignore-errors --]
git add -u #update  Update the index just where it already has an entry matching <pathspec>. This removes as well as modifies index entries to match the working tree, but **adds no new files.**
git add -A==--all==--no-ignore-removal  # Update the index not only where the working tree has a file matching <pathspec> but also where the index already has an entry. This adds, modifies, and removes index entries to match the working tree. If no <pathspec> is given when -A option is used, all files in the entire working tree are updated
git rm <=> rm & git add
git add --no-all==--ignore-removal  # Update the index by adding new files that are unknown to the index and files modified in the working tree, but ignore files that have been removed from the working tree. This option is a no-op when no <pathspec> is used. This option is primarily to help users who are used to older versions of Git
git add -- # This option can be used to separate command-line options from the list of files, (useful when filenames might be mistaken for command-line options).


git add -i # interactive
git add -p # Interactively choose hunks of patch
git add -e # Open the diff vs. the index in an editor and let the user edit it. After the editor was closed, adjust the hunk headers and apply the patch to the index. The intent of this option is to pick and choose lines of the patch to apply, or even to modify the contents of lines to be staged.

git add -n==--dry-run
git add --force # Allow adding otherwise ignored files.

# commiting/staging for commit
git commit -m "..."  # <=> 1. git revert 2. git reset HEAD^ (--mixed) 3. git reset --hard origin/master (local files will be changed!)
git commit -a  # == git add <all modified> + git commit

git checkout -b branchname
git status

git diff <commit> # - commit [vs worktree] +
	git diff master
	git diff origin/master
git diff --cached <commit> # - commit [vs cached] +
	git diff --cached master # cached vs local master branch (after committed)

## Terminology

### git
**0. not shown in untracked files** <--(gitignore)-- **1. untracked files in workdir** <--(`git checkout --`/`git restore`)--|--(modify/new/delete/rename)--> **2. changes not staged for commit** <--(`git reset HEAD`/`git restore --staged`)--|--(`git add`/track/stage)--> **3. staging area(index)/Changes to be committed** <--(`git reset --mixed/--soft/--hard`)--|--(`git commit`/stage for commit)--> **4. a commit in HEAD (local repo)** --(`git push`)--> **5. a branch in a remote repository**

### PyCharm

**Ignored Files** <--gitignore-- **Unversioned Files (workdir)** --add/track/stage--> **Changes in Changelist / Excluded (index)**

## config (1. `/usr/local/etc/gitconfig`, 2.`~/.config/git/config`, 3. `~/.gitconfig`, 4. `<repo>/.git/config`, 5.`<repo>/.git/config.worktree`)
5 files in the order of reading, the last value takes precedence over values read earlier:

 - system: `$(prefix)/etc/gitconfig`, i.e., `/usr/local/etc/gitconfig` usually (The prefix environment variable git was compiled with.)

    - Bonus: `/etc` vs `/usr/local/etc or $prefix/etc`: `/etc` is used by your OS for its configuration files

      `/usr/local/etc` can be used for your config files by you and your addtionally installed software

 - global (Second user-specific): `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/config` or `$HOME/.config/git/config` if `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is not set. Overriddable by `~/.gitconfig`.

    - `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is analogous to `/etc`, but should be default to `~/.config`

 - global (user-specific): ~/.gitconfig

 - repository: <repo>/.git/config

 - worktree: <repo>/.git/config.worktree (if extensions.worktreeConfig is present)

```bash
git config --system/--global/--local/--worktree

git config --global user.name "Chiao-Wei Hsu"
git config --global user.email "cwhsu@iis.sinica.edu.tw"

git config http.postBuffer 524288000  # Fix: The remote end hung up unexpectedly
```
```
user.username
core.autocrlf true
core.filemode false
core.editor vim
core.excludesfile <ignore_file>
core.whitespace fix,-indent-with-non-tab,trailing-space,cr-at-eol

web.browser google-chrome

diff.tool vimdiff
difftool.prompt false
alias.<name> ...

core.quotepath false
log.showSignature false
http.sslbackend schannel  # for windows
credential.helper 
```

## Resolve merge conflicts

```bash
git mergetool
```

## Alias

```bash
#config (1)
git config --global alias.lgb "log --graph --pretty=format:'%Cred%h%Creset -%C(yellow)%d%Creset %s %Cgreen(%cr) %C(bold blue)<%an>%Creset%n' --abbrev-commit --date=relative --branches"
git lgb


#config (2)
# in ~/.gitconfig
[alias]
    l = log --graph --oneline --decorate
    ll = log --graph --oneline --decorate --branches --tags
    lll = log --graph --oneline --decorate --all
```

## rm
Remove files from the index, or from the working tree and the index. 
 - git rm will not remove a file from just your working directory. (There is no option to remove a file only from the working tree and yet keep it in the index; use /bin/rm if you want to do that.)
 - The files being removed have to be identical to the tip of the branch, and no updates to their contents can be staged in the index, though that default behavior can be overridden with the -f option. 
 - When --cached is given, the staged content has to match either the tip of the branch or the file on disk, allowing the file to be removed from just the index.

## .git/info/exclude vs .gitignore vs ~/.gitignore (setting up manually required)

ref: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22906851/when-would-you-use-git-info-exclude-instead-of-gitignore-to-exclude-files

### .git/info/exclude vs .gitignore

> The advantage of .gitignore is that it can be checked into the repository itself, unlike .git/info/exclude. Another advantage is that you can have multiple .gitignore files, one inside each directory/subdirectory for directory specific ignore rules, unlike .git/info/exclude.
> So, .gitignore is available across all clones of the repository. Therefore, in large teams all people are ignoring the same kind of files Example *.db, *.log. And you can have more specific ignore rules because of multiple .gitignore.
> .git/info/exclude is available for individual clones only, hence what one person ignores in his clone is not available in some other person's clone. For example, if someone uses Eclipse for development it may make sense for that developer to add .build folder to .git/info/exclude because other devs may not be using Eclipse.
> In general, files/ignore rules that have to be universally ignored should go in .gitignore, and otherwise files that you want to ignore only on your local clone should go into .git/info/exclude

### ~/.gitignore

setup manually

```bash
# Linux
git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore
```

```powershell
# Windows
git config --global core.excludesfile %USERPROFILE%\.gitignore
```

These will add to the ~/.gitconfig file

```ini
[core]
        excludesfile = /home/username/.gitignore
```



## undo

```bash
git reset --hard|mixed|soft ORIG_HEAD # move the HEAD and branch ref pointer to a specified commit; default to mixed
 - soft: HEAD
 - mixed: HEAD, index
 - hard: HEAD, index, worktree (all)
 others:
	- --merge: HEAD, index, worktree that have no unstaged changes
	- --keep: HEAD, index, worktree (abort if  a file that is different between <commit> and HEAD has local changes)

git checkout # move the HEAD and branch ref pointer to a specified commit

git revert HEAD^# create a revert commit message

```

Command	| Scope |	Common use cases
---|---|---
git reset |	Commit-level |	Discard commits in a private branch or throw away uncommited changes
git reset |	File-level |	Unstage a file
git checkout |	Commit-level |	Switch between branches or inspect old snapshots
git checkout |	File-level |	Discard changes in the working directory
git revert |	Commit-level |	Undo commits in a public branch
git revert |	File-level |	(N/A)

## delete
```bash
git branch -d branchname

# use with care
git push origin --delete branchname
git push origin feature --force
```

## rebase

```bash
$ git rebase -i
$ git rebase --onto new_base [[--fork-point] upstream [branch]]
# As a special case, you may use "A...B" as a shortcut for the merge base of A and B if there is exactly one merge base. You can leave out at most one of A and B, in which case it defaults to HEAD, e.g. A... or ...B (means merge base of A...HEAD and HEAD...B)
$ git rebase --onto master next topic
# before
               o---o---o---o---o  master
                    \
                     o---o---o---o---o  next
                                      \
                                       o---o---o  topic
# after
               o---o---o---o---o  master
                   |            \
                   |             o'--o'--o'  topic
                    \
                     o---o---o---o---o  next

$ git rebase --keep-base
# Set the starting point at which to create the new commits to the merge base of <upstream> <branch>. Running git rebase --keep-base <upstream> <branch> is equivalent to running git rebase --onto <upstream>... <upstream>.
# https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53234798/can-i-rebase-on-a-branchs-fork-point-without-explicitly-specifying-the-parent
# The new "git rebase --keep-base <upstream>" tries to find the original base of the topic being rebased and rebase on top of that same base, which is useful when running the "git rebase -i" (and its limited variant "git rebase -x").
