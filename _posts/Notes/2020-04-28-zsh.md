## ZSH

```
sudo apt install zsh
~/.zshrc
```

## Enable Conda in ZSH

```
$ echo 'CONDA_CHANGEPS1=false' >> ~/.zshrc  # this should be before conda configuration as set by the `conda init zsh`. This will remove the "(env)" prefix before prompt.

$ conda init zsh  # this will modify ~/.zshrc to add conda configuration, e.g., go inside conda enironment, add to PATH, and change shell prompt, ...

# add 'CONDA_CHANGEPS1=true' before conda configuration in `~/.bashrc`  # this will preserve the prompt change in bash when calling `bash` in a zsh shell
```

## ZSH vs BASH vs SH Startup

https://blog.flowblok.id.au/2013-02/shell-startup-scripts.html

`.zshenv` → [`.zprofile` if login] → [`.zshrc` if interactive] → [`.zlogin` if login] → [`.zlogout` sometimes]

- `bash` complicates this in that `.bashrc` is **only read by a shell that's both \*interactive\* and \*non-login\***, so you'll find most people end up telling their `.bash_profile` to also read `.bashrc` with something like

```
[[ -r ~/.bashrc ]] && . ~/.bashrc
```

- The `~/.profile` file is read by all shells, while `~/.bash_profile` only by Bash
- some are only read by "login" shells (eg. when you login from another host, or login at the text console of a local unix machine). these are the ones called, say, `.login` or `.profile` or `.zlogin` (depending on which shell you're using).
- you have config files that are read by "interactive" shells (as in, ones connected to a terminal (or pseudo-terminal in the case of, say, a terminal emulator running under a windowing system). these are the ones with names like `.bashrc`, `.tcshrc`, `.zshrc`, etc.
-  `ENV` works in interactive `sh`, whereas `BASH_ENV` in non-interactive `bash`
  - **`BASH_ENV`**: If this variable is set when Bash is invoked to execute a shell script, its value is expanded and used as the name of a startup file to read before executing the script. See [Bash Startup Files](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html#Invoked-non_002dinteractively).

  - `ENV`: When invoked as an interactive shell with the name `sh`, Bash looks for the variable `ENV`, expands its value if it is defined, and uses the expanded value as the name of a file to read and execute.
