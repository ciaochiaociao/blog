```bash
dvc status
# Show changes in the project pipelines, as well as file mismatches either between the cache and workspace, or between the cache and remote storage.

dvc init
dvc add
dvc add --no-commit

dvc run -n -d -d -p -o/-O -m/-M '<command>'
dvc run --no-exec
dvc run --no-commit
dvc run --no-run-cache  # execute the stage command even if it has already been run with the same dependencies/outputs/etc. before. (Useful for example if the command's code is non-deterministic (not recommended).)

dvc run -f, --force  # - overwrite an existing stage in dvc.yaml file without asking for confirmation.

dvc run --outs-persist <path>  #  - declare output file or directory that will not be removed upon dvc repro.
dvc run --outs-persist-no-cache <path>   # - the same as -outs-persist except that outputs are not tracked by DVC.
dvc run --always-changed  # - always consider this stage as changed (uses the always_changed field in dvc.yaml). As a result dvc status will report it as always changed and dvc repro will always execute it.

dvc repro
dvc repro --no-commit --no-run-cache  # execute stage commands even if they have already been run with the same dependencies/outputs/etc. before.
dvc repro -f  # reproduce a pipeline, regenerating its results, even if no changes were found. This executes all of the stages by default, but it can be limited with the targets argument, or the -s, -p, -c options.
dvc repro -s, --single-item  # reproduce only a single stage by turning off the recursive search for changed dependencies.
