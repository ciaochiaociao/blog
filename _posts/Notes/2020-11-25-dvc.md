## dvc.lock
dvc.lock is built to record the relations between input (deps) and output(outs) when using `dvc commit`.

```
# in dvc.lock
dep1 hash, dep2 hash, ... ====> out1 hash, out2 hash
```

## dvc run

`dvc run` does:

1. Add stages to `dvc.yaml`, `.gitignore`

2. Execute commands defined in `dvc.yaml`

3. Run `dvc commit`, which 

   a. records `deps` and `outs` hashes in `dvc.lock`

   b. saves files to cache

## dvc commit

`dvc commit` does two things:

 - record `deps` and `outs` hashes in `dvc.lock`
 - save files in `deps` and `outs` to **cache directory** (`.dvc/cache`)



## Cookbook
```bash
dvc status
# Show changes in the project pipelines, as well as file mismatches either between the cache and workspace, or between the cache and remote storage.
dvc list --rev <tag/branch/commit> <path>
dvc list --rev HEAD^ .
dvc get -o testfile . requirements.txt --rev inference

dvc init
dvc add
dvc add --no-commit
git add <name>.dvc


dvc remove <name>.dvc

dvc run -n -d -d -p -o/-O -m/-M '<command>'

dvc run  # my note: same as `dvc stage add; dvc repro`
dvc run --no-exec  # (my note: same as `dvc stage add`)

dvc run --no-commit  # when playing around, or you don't want to cache files
dvc run --no-run-cache  # execute the stage command even if it has already been run with the same dependencies/outputs/etc. before. (Useful for example if the command's code is non-deterministic (not recommended).)
# my note: dvc stage add does not have the above two flags, while dvc repro has

dvc run -f, --force  # - overwrite an existing stage in dvc.yaml file without asking for confirmation. (To update a stage that is already defined)

# similar as but w/ exec
dvc stage add -f  # (To update a stage that is already defined)

dvc run --outs-persist <path>  #  - declare output file or directory that will not be removed upon dvc repro.
dvc run --outs-persist-no-cache <path>   # - the same as -outs-persist except that outputs are not tracked by DVC.
dvc run --always-changed  # - always consider this stage as changed (uses the always_changed field in dvc.yaml). As a result dvc status will report it as always changed and dvc repro will always execute it.

dvc repro
dvc repro --no-run-cache  # execute stage commands even if they have already been run with the same dependencies/outputs/etc. before.
dvc repro --no-commit  # Do not save the results to cache. Useful for rapid iteration or in pilot runs. (dvc.yaml and dvc.lock are still created or updated)
dvc repro -f  # reproduce a pipeline, regenerating its results, even if no changes were found. This executes all of the stages by default, but it can be limited with the targets argument, or the -s, -p, -c options.
dvc repro -s, --single-item  # reproduce only a single stage by turning off the recursive search for changed dependencies.

dvc commit
dvc commit --force/-f  # use case: When we slightly change the deps files but do not affect the outs files, force commit a stage will prevent from running all over again but directly cache the changed deps files.
dvc commit -d  # with dependencies
# different from
dvc commit -R  # subdirectories of the specified directory

dvc commit -f -d

dvc checkout
```
```
dvc remote list
dvc remote remove <name>
dvc remote add --global/--local/--system <name> <url>
dvc remote modify <name> ask_password true

dvc remote default [--local/--global/--system]  # get
dvc remote default <name>  # set
dvc remote default --unset/-u # unset

```

```
dvc remote modify --global kysuws02_pylucene ask_password true
```

`--system`: `/etc/xdg/dvc/config`

- Features I am looking forward to: human-readable cache  =>  `dvc pkg`, `dvc diff` with modifications
- Features to check in `v2.0`: `dvc exp`, `dvclive`

## Issues

- `dvc remote default` does not comply with the file `.dvc/config`: 

  - must use `dvc remote default <...>` to set default remote path instead of only (or after) `dvc remote default --local <...>` 

  - use `dvc remote default --unset/-u` to unset a default remote instead of modifying the `.dvc/config` directly
