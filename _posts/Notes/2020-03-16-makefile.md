## How it works

When `make` is asked to evaluate a rule, it begins by finding the files indicated by the prerequisites and target. If any of the prerequisites has an associated rule, `make` attempts to update those first. Next, the target file is considered. If any prerequisite is newer than the target, the target is remade by executing the commands. Each command line is passed to the shell and is executed in its own subshell. If any of the commands generates an error, the building of the target is terminated and `make` exits. One file is considered newer than another if it has been modified more recently.

## CLI

```
make
‘-n’
‘--just-print’
‘--dry-run’
‘--recon’  # “No-op”. Causes make to print the recipes that are needed to make the targets up to date, but not actually execute them.
```



## Use String Interpolation of Bash In Makefile

```
# opt1
Foo = ...
all:
        Foo='$(Foo)'; echo $${Foo/Bar/OK}

# opt2
Foo = ...
export Foo
all:
        echo $${Foo/Bar/OK}

```

## Shell Commands in Makefile
As indicated in the question, every sub-command is run in its own shell. This makes writing non-trivial shell scripts a little bit messy -- but it is possible! The solution is to consolidate your script into what make will consider a single sub-command (a single line).

Tips for writing shell scripts within makefiles:
- Escape the script's use of $ by replacing with $$
- Convert the script to work as a single line by inserting ; between commands
- If you want to write the script on multiple lines, escape end-of-line with \
- Optionally start with set -e to match make's provision to abort on sub-command failure
- This is totally optional, but you could bracket the script with () or {} to emphasize the cohesiveness of a multiple line sequence -- that this is not a typical makefile command sequence
```
mytarget:
    { \
    set -e ;\
    msg="header:" ;\
    for i in $$(seq 1 3) ; do msg="$$msg pre_$${i}_post" ; done ;\
    msg="$$msg :footer" ;\
    echo msg=$$msg ;\
    }
```
## Environment Variable / Inputs
You have several options to set up variables from outside your makefile:
- From environment - each environment variable is transformed into a makefile variable with the same name and value.
```
# best way
FOO?=default_value_if_not_set_in_environment  #in Makefile
FOO=...  # in shell
make ...  # in shell

# less better way
FOO=... # in shell
make --environments-override ...  # make -e # in shell
```
- From command line - make can take variable assignments as part of his command line, mingled with targets:
```
make target FOO=bar
```
- Exporting from the parent Make - if you call Make from a Makefile, you usually shouldn't explicitly write variable assignments like this
```
# Do like this
CFLAGS=-g
export CFLAGS
target:
        $(MAKE) -C target
				
# Don't do this!
target:
        $(MAKE) -C target CC=$(CC) CFLAGS=$(CFLAGS)
```

## Syntax
```
FOO?=default_value_if_not_set_in_environment  # (the conditional variable assignment operator, it only has an effect if the variable is not yet defined)
```
- prepend shell commands with '@' to suppress printing the command itself. Shell output is still visible. (The @ character has to be at the beginning of the command, directly after the tab.)
- Use a variable with $(VARNAME): dollar sign and enclosed in parentheses. Single-letter variables can omit the parentheses
- Parallel builds: make -j to use all available cores make -j2 to use two cores
- Set a variable with VARNAME = value Variable values can contains spaces: no need to escape them or quote them.

### `=`, `!=`, `:=`/`::=`, `?=`

- recursively expanded ( The value you specify is installed verbatim; if it contains references to other variables, these references are expanded whenever this variable is substituted (in the course of expanding some other string): 
	- Variables defined with ‘=’ are recursively expanded variables. 
	- or by the define directive (see Defining Multi-Line Variables).
- Simply expanded variables:
	- Variables defined with ‘:=’ or ‘::=’ are simply expanded variables; these definitions can contain variable references which will be expanded before the definition is made. (The value of a simply expanded variable is scanned once and for all, expanding any references to other variables and functions, when the variable is defined. The actual value of the simply expanded variable is the result of expanding the text that you write. It does not contain any references to other variables; it contains their values as of the time this variable was defined.)
	- Prevent **infinite loop**
- The shell assignment operator ‘!=’ can be used to execute a shell script and set a variable to its output. ( This operator first evaluates the right-hand side, then passes that result to the shell for execution. If the result of the execution ends in a newline, that one newline is removed; all other newlines are replaced by spaces. The resulting string is then placed into the named recursively-expanded variable)
- If you’d like a variable to be set to a value only if it’s not already set, then you can use the shorthand operator ‘?=’ instead of ‘=’
## Automatic Variables

https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Automatic-Variables.html
```
$@
The file name of the target of the rule. If the target is an archive member, then ‘$@’ is the name of the archive file. In a pattern rule that has multiple targets (see Introduction to Pattern Rules), ‘$@’ is the name of whichever target caused the rule’s recipe to be run.

$%
The target member name, when the target is an archive member. See Archives. For example, if the target is foo.a(bar.o) then ‘$%’ is bar.o and ‘$@’ is foo.a. ‘$%’ is empty when the target is not an archive member.

$<
The name of the first prerequisite. If the target got its recipe from an implicit rule, this will be the first prerequisite added by the implicit rule (see Implicit Rules).

$?
The names of all the prerequisites that are newer than the target, with spaces between them. If the target does not exist, all prerequisites will be included. For prerequisites which are archive members, only the named member is used (see Archives).

$^
The names of all the prerequisites, with spaces between them. For prerequisites which are archive members, only the named member is used (see Archives). A target has only one prerequisite on each other file it depends on, no matter how many times each file is listed as a prerequisite. So if you list a prerequisite more than once for a target, the value of $^ contains just one copy of the name. This list does not contain any of the order-only prerequisites; for those see the ‘$|’ variable, below.

$+
This is like ‘$^’, but prerequisites listed more than once are duplicated in the order they were listed in the makefile. This is primarily useful for use in linking commands where it is meaningful to repeat library file names in a particular order.

$|
The names of all the order-only prerequisites, with spaces between them.

$*
The stem with which an implicit rule matches (see How Patterns Match). If the target is dir/a.foo.b and the target pattern is a.%.b then the stem is dir/foo. The stem is useful for constructing names of related files.

‘$(@D)’
The directory part of the file name of the target, with the trailing slash removed. If the value of ‘$@’ is dir/foo.o then ‘$(@D)’ is dir. This value is . if ‘$@’ does not contain a slash.

‘$(@F)’
The file-within-directory part of the file name of the target. If the value of ‘$@’ is dir/foo.o then ‘$(@F)’ is foo.o. ‘$(@F)’ is equivalent to ‘$(notdir $@)’.

‘$(*D)’
‘$(*F)’
The directory part and the file-within-directory part of the stem; dir and foo in this example.

‘$(%D)’
‘$(%F)’
The directory part and the file-within-directory part of the target archive member name. This makes sense only for archive member targets of the form archive(member) and is useful only when member may contain a directory name. (See Archive Members as Targets.)

‘$(<D)’
‘$(<F)’
The directory part and the file-within-directory part of the first prerequisite.

‘$(^D)’
‘$(^F)’
Lists of the directory parts and the file-within-directory parts of all prerequisites.

‘$(+D)’
‘$(+F)’
Lists of the directory parts and the file-within-directory parts of all prerequisites, including multiple instances of duplicated prerequisites.

‘$(?D)’
‘$(?F)’
Lists of the directory parts and the file-within-directory parts of all prerequisites that are newer than the target.

## Use Scenario of `:=` - Make Subdir
```
ifeq (0,${MAKELEVEL})
whoami    := $(shell whoami)
host-type := $(shell arch)
MAKE := ${MAKE} host-type=${host-type} whoami=${whoami}
endif
```

```
${subdirs}:
        ${MAKE} -C $@ all
```

`make some_sub_dir ...`

## Secondary Expansion

https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Secondary-Expansion.html#Secondary-Expansion

GNU `make` works in two distinct phases: a **read-in phase** and a **target-update phase**

1. During the first phase it reads all the makefiles, included makefiles, etc. and **internalizes all the variables and their values and implicit and explicit rules, and builds a dependency graph of all the targets and their prerequisites. **
2. During the second phase, `make` uses this internalized data to **determine which targets need to be updated and run the recipes necessary to update them.**

(https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Reading-Makefiles.html#Reading-Makefiles)

If that special target is defined then **in between the two phases mentioned above, right at the end of the read-in phase**, all the prerequisites of the targets defined after the special target are expanded a *second time*.

```
.SECONDEXPANSION:
ONEVAR = onefile
TWOVAR = twofile
myfile: $(ONEVAR) $$(TWOVAR)
# After the first expansion phase the prerequisites list of the myfile target will be onefile and $(TWOVAR); the first (unescaped) variable reference to ONEVAR is expanded, while the second (escaped) variable reference is simply unescaped, without being recognized as a variable reference.
```

```
.SECONDEXPANSION:
AVAR = top
onefile: $(AVAR)
twofile: $$(AVAR)
AVAR = bottom

# Here the prerequisite of onefile will be expanded immediately, and resolve to the value top, while the prerequisite of twofile will not be full expanded until the secondary expansion and yield a value of bottom.
```
