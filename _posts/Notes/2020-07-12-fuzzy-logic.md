- **Fuzzy logic** is a form of [many-valued logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-valued_logic) in which the [truth values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_value) of variables may be any [real number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number) between 0 and 1 both inclusive.
- Both degrees of truth and [probabilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability) range between 0 and 1 and hence may seem similar at first, but fuzzy logic uses degrees of truth as a [mathematical model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model) of *vagueness*, while [probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability) is a mathematical model of *ignorance*.[[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzy_logic#cite_note-7)

- Computational theorist [Leslie Valiant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_Valiant) uses the term *ecorithms* to describe how many less exact systems and techniques like fuzzy logic (and "less robust" logic) can be applied to [learning algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_algorithms).
- In general use, ecorithms are algorithms that learn from their more complex environments (hence *eco-*) to generalize, approximate and simplify solution logic.
- Ecorithms and fuzzy logic also have the common property of dealing with possibilities more than probabilities, although feedback and [feed forward](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feed_forward_(control)), basically stochastic weights, are a feature of both when dealing with, for example, dynamical systems.
