title: Conda
---

## Basics
conda can install
 - explicit conda package filenames (e.g. ./lxml-3.2.0-py27_0.tar.bz2)
 - If a package is not available from conda or Anaconda.org, you may be able to find and install the package via conda-forge or with another package manager like pip.

## Activation

- Activation entails two primary functions: 
  - adding entries to PATH for the environment and 
  - running any activation scripts that the environment may contain. 
    - These activation scripts are how packages can set arbitrary environment variables that may be necessary for their operation. 
    - You can also [use the config API to set environment variables](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#set-env-vars).
- When [installing Anaconda](http://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install.html), you have the option to “Add Anaconda to my PATH environment variable.” This is **not recommended** because the add to PATH option appends Anaconda to PATH. When the installer appends to PATH, it does not call the activation scripts.
- On Windows, PATH is composed of two parts, the system PATH and the user PATH. The system PATH always comes first. When you install Anaconda for Just Me, we add it to the user PATH. When you install for All Users, we add it to the system PATH. In the former case, you can end up with system PATH values taking precedence over our entries. In the latter case, you do not. **We do not recommend [multi-user installs](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/multi-user/).**
- **Activation prepends to PATH**. This only takes effect when you have the environment active so it is local to a terminal session, not global.

## Nested activation

By default, `conda activate` will deactivate the current environment before activating the new environment and reactivate it when deactivating the new environment. Sometimes you may want to leave the current environment PATH entries in place **so that you can continue to easily access command-line programs from the first environment. This is most commonly encountered when common command-line utilities are installed in the base environment.** To retain the current environment in the PATH, you can activate the new environment using:

```
conda activate --stack myenv
```

If you wish to always stack when going from the outermost environment, which is typically the base environment, you can set the `auto_stack` configuration option:

```
conda config --set auto_stack 1
```

You may specify a larger number for a deeper level of automatic stacking, but this is not recommended since deeper levels of stacking are more likely to lead to confusion.

## [Installing non-conda packages](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-pkgs.html#id5)

- **Pip packages do not have all the features of conda packages** and we recommend first trying to install any package with conda. If the package is unavailable through conda, try finding and installing it with conda-forge.
- If you still cannot install the package, you can try installing it with pip. **The differences between pip and conda packages cause certain unavoidable limits in compatibility** but conda works hard to be as compatible with pip as possible.
- **Both pip and conda are included in Anaconda and Miniconda**, so you do not need to install them separately.
- **Conda environments replace virtualenv**, so there is no need to activate a virtualenv before using pip.
- It is **possible to have pip installed outside** a conda environment **or inside** a conda environment.
- **To gain the benefits of conda integration, be sure to install pip inside the currently active conda environment and then install packages with that instance of pip.** The command `conda list` shows packages installed this way, with a label showing that they were installed with pip.
  - You can install pip in the current conda environment with the command conda install pip, as discussed in Using pip in an environment.
- If there are instances of pip installed both inside and outside the current conda environment, **the instance of pip installed inside the current conda environment is used.**
- To install a non-conda package:
  1. Activate the environment where you want to put the program:
     - On Windows, in your Anaconda Prompt, run `activate myenv`.
     - On macOS and Linux, in your terminal window, run `conda activate myenv`.
  2. To use pip to install a program such as See, in your terminal window or an Anaconda Prompt, run: `pip install see`
  3. To verify the package was installed, in your terminal window or an Anaconda Prompt, run: `conda list`

## Managing virtual packages

- "Virtual" packages are **injected into the conda solver** to **allow real packages to depend on features present on the system that cannot be managed directly by conda**, like *system driver versions* or *CPU features*. 
- Virtual packages are **not real packages** and not displayed by `conda list`. Instead `conda` runs a small bit of code to detect the presence or absence of the system feature that corresponds to the package. The currently supported list of virtual packages includes: `__cuda`, `__osx`, `__glibc`, `__linux`, `__unix`, `__win`
- Related ENVs: `CONDA_OVERRIDE_CUDA`, `CONDA_OVERRIDE_OSX`, `CONDA_OVERRIDE_GLIBC`

## [Using pip in an environment](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#id12)

To use pip in your environment, in your terminal window or an Anaconda Prompt, run:

```
conda install -n myenv pip
conda activate myenv
pip <pip_subcommand>
```

Issues may arise when using pip and conda together. When combining conda and pip, it is best to use an isolated conda environment. Only after conda has been used to install as many packages as possible should pip be used to install any remaining software. If modifications are needed to the environment, it is best to create a new environment rather than running conda after pip. When appropriate, conda and pip requirements should be stored in text files.

We recommend that you:

- **Use pip only after conda**

  Install as many requirements as possible with conda then use pip.Pip should be run with `--upgrade-strategy only-if-needed` (the default).Do not use pip with the `--user` argument, avoid all users installs.

- **Use conda environments for isolation**

  Create a conda environment to isolate any changes pip makes.Environments take up little space thanks to hard links.Care should be taken to avoid running pip in the root environment.

- **Recreate the environment if changes are needed**

  Once pip has been used, conda will be unaware of the changes.To install additional conda packages, it is best to recreate the environment.

- **Store conda and pip requirements in text files**

  Package requirements can be passed to conda via the `--file` argument.Pip accepts a list of Python packages with `-r` or `--requirements`.Conda env will export or create environments based on a file with conda and pip requirements.

## Pinning

In the environment's `conda-meta` directory, add a file named `pinned` that includes a list of the packages that you do not want updated.

EXAMPLE: The file below forces NumPy to stay on the 1.7 series, which is any version that starts with 1.7. This also forces SciPy to stay at exactly version 0.14.2:

```
# in ./conda-meta/pinned
numpy 1.7.*
scipy ==0.14.2

# use this to ignore pinned
conda install --no-pin  
```

## conda create vs conda env create

> https://github.com/conda/conda/issues/10381#issuecomment-735975903
>
> for `conda create` the `--file` argument takes a file with a list of packages/versions to install ([docs](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/commands/create.html#conda-create)) like a `requirements.txt`
> for `conda env create` the `--file` refers to a yaml file that specifies the details of the environment, channel, name, etc

>https://github.com/conda/conda/issues/5253#issuecomment-609518753
>
>I find this confusing as well. There are options to `conda create` that do not appear to be available in `conda env create`. For example, you can specify `--strict-channel-priority` to `conda create` but you can't specify that argument to `conda env create` nor does there appear to be a way to specify strict channel priority in the yml file.

## [Do newly created conda envs inherit all packages from the base env?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52433517/do-newly-created-conda-envs-inherit-all-packages-from-the-base-env)

You can create a clone of the base environment using `conda create --name dell_proj --clone root`. This will create a new environment that is a copy of your base environment.

If you created the new environment using something like `conda create --name dell_proj`, it will not inherit packages from the base environment. You would have to install the packages you want using `conda install`.

## Troubleshooting

 - WARNING conda.gateways.disk.delete:unlink_or_rename_to_trash(138): Could not remove or rename /opt/conda/conda-meta/regex-2019.04.14-py36h7b6447c_0.json.  Please remove this file manually (you may need to reboot to free file handles)
   
    - Cause:
      
       - use both pip and conda for installing packages (created one environment and installed packages using `pip install` while inside another environment I was trying `conda install`)
    - Solution:   
       ```bash
       # https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62215850/warning-conda-gateways-diskunlink-or-rename-to-trash140
       conda clean --all
       ```

```bash
sudo $(which conda) update conda  # for updating the conda installed with root priviledge


```
## environment folder

- Check by `conda info -e/--envs` or `cat ~/.conda/environments.txt`

- base environment: `<root_prefix> (PREFIX)` specified using `~/miniconda.sh -p PREFIX`  installer command (e.g. `/usr/local/conda/` or `/opt/conda/`)

  check `root_prefix` by 

  ```
  conda config --show root_prefix
  ```

- other environments: 

  - `<root_prefix>/envs/<env_name>` or
  - `prefix` value defined in `environment.yml`: e.g. `~/.conda/envs/env_name`

## .condarc

 - user (default): `~/.condarc`
 - env: `<env_folder>/.condarc`
    - `<prefix>`: installed path of conda e.g. `/opt/conda` or the `prefix` value defined in `environment.yml`
 - system: `<base_prefix>/.condarc`

## Conda running very slow

1. More specific version
2. channel_priority set to `strict` (default in 4.6) instead of `flexible` (default in 4.9)
3. channel priority order
4. package priority order

```bash

```
