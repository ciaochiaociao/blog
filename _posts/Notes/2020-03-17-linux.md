## Temp file
https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/181937/how-create-a-temporary-file-in-shell-script

`&3` as a temporary file
```
tmp="$(mktemp)"
exec 3> "$tmp"
rm "$tmp"
...
echo ... >&3
```

`sed ... file | sponge file` = `sed ... file  sponge file`

## NICE
ref: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nice_(Unix)
nice becomes useful when several processes are demanding more resources than the CPU can provide. In this state, a higher-priority process will get a larger chunk of the CPU time than a lower-priority process. Only the superuser (root) may set the niceness to a lower value (i.e. a higher priority). On Linux it is possible to change /etc/security/limits.conf to allow other users or groups to set low nice values.[1]

If a user wanted to compress a large file, but not slow down other processes, they might run the following:
```
$ nice -n 19 tar cvzf archive.tgz largefile
```
## Logs
What’s in these Linux Logs?
* /var/log/syslog or /var/log/messages:
	Shows general messages and info regarding the system. Basically a data log of all activity throughout the global system. Know that everything that happens on Redhat-based systems, like CentOS or Rhel, will go in messages. Whereas for Ubuntu and other Debian systems, they go in Syslog.
* /var/log/auth.log or /var/log/secure:
	 Keep authentication logs for both successful or failed logins, and authentication processes. Storage depends on system type. For Debian/Ubuntu, look in /var/log/auth.log. For Redhat/CentrOS, go to /var/log/secure.
* /var/log/boot.log: start-up messages and boot info.
* /var/log/maillog or var/log/mail.log: is for mail server logs, handy for postfix, smtpd, or email-related services info running on your server.
* /var/log/kern: keeps in Kernel logs and warning info. Also useful to fix problems with custom kernels.
* /var/log/dmesg: a repository for device driver messages. Use dmesg to see messages in this file.
* /var/log/faillog: records info on failed logins. Hence, handy for examining potential security breaches like login credential hacks and brute-force attacks.
* /var/log/cron: keeps a record of Crond-related messages (cron jobs). Like when the cron daemon started a job.
* /var/log/daemon.log: keeps track of running background services but doesn’t represent them graphically.
* /var/log/btmp: keeps a note of all failed login attempts.
* /var/log/utmp: current login state by user.
* /var/log/wtmp: record of each login/logout.
* /var/log/lastlog: holds every user’s last login. A binary file you can read via lastlog command.
* /var/log/yum.log: holds data on any package installations that used the yum command. So you can check if all went well.
* /var/log/httpd/: a directory containing error_log and access_log files of the Apache httpd daemon. Every error that httpd comes across is kept in the error_log file. Think of memory problems and other system-related errors. access_log logs all requests which come in via HTTP.
* /var/log/mysqld.log or /var/log/mysql.log : MySQL log file that records every  debug, failure and success message, including starting, stopping and restarting of MySQL daemon mysqld. The system decides on the directory. RedHat, CentOS, Fedora, and other RedHat-based systems use /var/log/mariadb/mariadb.log. However, Debian/Ubuntu use /var/log/mysql/error.log directory.
* /var/log/pureftp.log: monitors for FTP connections using the pureftp process. Find data on every connection, FTP login, and authentication failure here.
* /var/log/spooler: Usually contains nothing, except rare messages from USENET.
* /var/log/xferlog: keeps FTP file transfer sessions. Includes info like file names and user-initiated FTP transfers.

## LVM

The /dev/mapper/ubuntu--vg-root in place of a traditional /dev/sdxN block device just indicates that you chose to install the system using LVM2 logical volume management. 

You can think of LVM as "dynamic partitions", meaning that you can create/resize/delete LVM "partitions" (they're called "Logical Volumes" in LVM-speak) from the command line *while your Linux system is running*: no need to reboot the system to make the kernel aware of the newly-created or resized partitions.

Other nice features that LVM "Logical Volumes" provide are:

1. If you have more than one hard-disk, Logical Volumes can extend over more than one disk: i.e., they are not limited by the size of one single disk, rather by the total aggregate size.
2. You can set up "striped" LVs, so that I/O can be distributed to all disks hosting the LV in parallel. (Similar to RAID-0, but a bit easier to set-up.)
3. You can create a (read-only) snapshot of any LV. You can revert the original LV to the snapshot at a later time, or delete the snapshot if you no longer need it. This is handy for server backups for instance (you cannot stop all your applications from writing, so you create a snapshot and backup the snapshot LV), but can also be used to provide a "safety net" before a critical system upgrade (clone the root partition, upgrade, revert if something went wrong).

While being most useful on server systems, I think that features 1. and 3., combined with LVM's ability to create/resize/delete LVs on the fly, are quite handy on desktop systems as well. (Especially if you experiment a lot with the system.)

### Downsides

Of course, all of this comes at a price: the initial setup of LVM is more complex than just partitioning a disk, and you will definitely need to understand the LVM terminology and model (Logical Volumes, Physical Volumes, Volume Groups) before you can *start* using it. (Once it is set up, using it is much easier, though.)

Also, if you use LVM across hard drives, you may lose all your data when only one drive fails.

- **PV** : Physical Volumes. This means the hard disk, hard disk partitions, RAID or LUNs from a SAN which form "Physical Volumes" (or PVs).
- **VG** : Volume Groups. This is a collection of one or more Physical Volumes.
- **LV** : Logical Volumes. LVs sit inside a Volume Group and form, in effect, a virtual partition.
- **PE** : Physical Extents. In order to manipulate the actual data, it is divided into blocks of data called **P**hysical **E**xtents.
- **LE** : Logical Extents. Similar to Physical Extents, but at the Logical Volume level. Physical Extents are to Physical Volumes as Logical Extents are to Logical Volumes. The size of blocks are the same for each logical volume (LV) in the same volume group (VG).
