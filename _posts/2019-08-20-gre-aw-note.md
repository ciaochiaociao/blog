### Response

**Intro Paragraph**

> While it is true that most students can gain valuable experiences by studying abroad, some students may have to concentrate on their research or study. If these students are required to go abroad for one semester, their study may be interrupted. Therefore, in contrast to the statement, I believe that most students should be encouraged to study abroad for one semester, instead of being forced to go abroad.

- Claim: encouraged to study abroad for one semester instead of being forced to go abroad. (Here a reason has been mentioned slightly: their study may be interrupted.)

- Strategy: stand in a more middle position, and propose a slightly modified alternative to the original argument

- Good Templates/Words/Collocation: 
  - While it is true that most ..., some ....
  - in contrast to the statement

**Argument Paragraph 1**

> Most students need to speak fluent English. If they study abroad for one semester, their English abilities would improve greatly. For example, most students in Taiwan have no chance to speak English in their learning environment, but most of them will have to talk with clients all around the world in the future because most Taiwanese companies are export-oriented. If these students studied abroad for one semester, they would have lots of chances to speak English when they are buying food, participating in classroom discussion, and chatting with other students sitting next to them. The teacher may also ask them to answer questions in the classroom. After listening to how other people answer questions and how they talk with their friends, Taiwanese students can learn how to confidently express themselves in English.

- Main sentences - Reason: 
  
  > Most students need to speak fluent English.

- Supporting sentences - From Claim to Reason (From Cause to Wanted Effect):

  > If they study abroad for one semester, their English abilities would improve greatly.

- Exemplar sentences:

  > For example, most students in Taiwan have no chance to speak English in their learning environment, but most of them will have to talk with clients all around the world in the future because most Taiwanese companies are export-oriented.
  
  Remarks: Indicate that the wanted effect does not exist, and the reason why the wanted effect is important

  > If these students studied abroad for one semester, they would have lots of chances to speak English when they are buying food, participating in classroom discussion, and chatting with other students sitting next to them.

  > The teacher may also ask them to answer questions in the classroom. After listening to how other people answer questions and how they talk with their friends, Taiwanese students can learn how to confidently express themselves in English.

**_Analysis_**

![argument1 mind map](/blog/assets/images/study_abroad1.svg) 

*Position/Claim/Stance (cause)*: go abroad to study for one semester

*Reason (the wanted effect)*: (Most students need to) speak fluent English.

*Support/Examples (**how the position causes the wanted effect** / how the effect cause the other wanted effect)*: If these students studied abroad for one semester, they would have lots of chances to speak English when they are buying food, participating in classroom discussion, and chatting with other students sitting next to them. The teacher may also ask them to answer questions in the classroom. After listening to how other people answer questions and how they talk with their friends, Taiwanese students can learn how to confidently express themselves in English.

**Argument Paragraph 2**

> In addition, students need to know how to make friends with people in other countries. If they go abroad to study for one semester, they can meet people from different countries in a short period of time. For example, most Taiwanese students only have Taiwanese classmates. Even if they go traveling abroad, they will only have a brief chat with other travelers. In contrast, if they study abroad for one semester, they will have to spend months with roommates in their dormitory or with classmates at school. They can study together, travel together, and even drink beers at night together. These precious experiences will make students more open-minded and know what to do when they work in a global company in the future.

- Main sentences - Reason:

  > students need to know how to make friends with people in other countries.

- Supporting sentences: establish the link between the reason and your position (wanted effect)

  > If they go abroad to study for one semester, they can meet people from different countries in a short period of time.

**Counter Argument Paragraph**
> Still, it is true that some students have sound reasons not to study abroad for one semester. Some students cannot afford the expenses associated with going abroad, and some need to focus on their research projects. Therefore, instead of requiring students to study abroad, school should encourage students to do so. If students decide to stay in their home country, then their decision should be respected. If the reason why students choose not to go abroad is that they do not have enough money, the school should partner with foreign schools where tuition and living expenses are low.

- Concession on opposite position:

> To conclude, students can gain many benefits if they study abroad for one semester, but as some students do not have time or money to do so, the school should encourage students to study abroad instead of requiring them to go abroad.
