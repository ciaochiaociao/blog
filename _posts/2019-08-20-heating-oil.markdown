# Content
The author in this letter advises clients to invest in Consolidated Industries. However, some assumptions need to be answered.

The author claims that, a low temperature weather in the northeastern United States in the past three months will continue for the following couples of years based on a climate forecaster. Implicitly, it is assumed a high credibility of this forecasting report. However, whether this report out of wherever it comes from should be trusted needs to be confirmed. Maybe the forecaster is just a senior year student who was merely working in an internship with this firm of service of investing advices, or the company is just hiring another person who is a good sales of selling investing plan but does not know anything about the science of the nature. At least a background overview of the source should be provided in this letter.

Furthermore, the author believed that a trend of recently built new houses will lead to a rising need for heating oil. Although it is true that people tended to use oil for the heating of their house, the growth of the heating demand is not guaranteed because an even stronger trend that both the market and the construction company tend to adopt more green technology such as solar powered heating system or utilize an electric system for the consideration of the danger of using a lot of oil in their house.

Even if the trend is happening, the author further assumes that the client can benefit from the investment in a company whose major business is the retail sale of home heating oil due to this trend. Still, the credential of the profit increase in this company should be provided. It is possible that the upstream company can not afford the increasing amount of the need for the oil, the price of which rises up consequently, resulting in a lower profit due to the increase of the cost. 

Therefore, the author should provide more credentials to make his investment advice more trustable to persuade the client make the investing decision.
